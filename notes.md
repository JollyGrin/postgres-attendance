DCL Attendance Idea:

- create a script that can be loaded into any DCL scene by the owner
- when a scene has a tracking script enabled, immediately starts tracking to attendance table
- backend will chronjob Decentraland Events page to scrape all visible events, add to db in events table

TODO 
- [ ]  api request to dcl events, and populate events table
- [x] migration, add 137,-2 to data




Needed APIs

- [ ] Get attendance records for location between start/end time
